# Plugin Utilities

The plugin utilities are for those who want to extend Chai with their own set of
assertions. The [Code Plugin Concepts]({{site.github.url}}/guide/plugins) and
[Building a Helper]({{site.github.url}}/guide/helpers) guide tutorials are a great reference on
how to get started with your own assertions.
