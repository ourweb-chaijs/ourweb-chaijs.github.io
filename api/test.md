# Online Test Suite

This is the test suite that we use to test Chai during development. Use it to confirm
that Chai will function correctly in your browser environment (`should` does
not work in IE9). These tests are powered by the awesome [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/)
test framework.
