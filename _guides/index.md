# Welcome to Chai

We are glad that you have decided to give Chai.js a try! If this is your first
visit, get acquainted with the basics, such as installation and our included
assertion styles.

## The Basics

- [Install Chai](/guide/installation/) in node, the browser, and other environments.
- [Learn about styles](/guide/styles/) that you can use to define assertions.

## Making Plugins

After you have a solid knowledge of what is included in Chai, the next step is
learning how to extend Chai through plugins. Chai is infinitely more powerful
than what is included, limited only by what you want to achieve. The Plugin API
is also intended as a way to simplify testing by providing users a way to
encapsulate common assertions for repeat use.

- [Core Plugin Concepts](/guide/plugins/) covers the basics of using the Chai Plugin API.
- [Building a Helper](/guide/helpers/) is a walkthrough for writing your first plugin.
